Description: The childdevdata package bundles publicly available datasets with 
    individual milestone data for children aged 0-5 years. Measuring child 
    development starts by collecting responses to developmental milestones,
    such as "able to sit" or "says two words". There are many ways to combine 
    such responses into summaries. This package aims to support the construction, 
    evaluation, validation and interpretation of methodologies that aggregate 
    milestone data into informative measures of child development.
